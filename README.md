In the first phase:
● Our main task was to understand the schema of the given Trajectory Dataset and store it in such a
way that performing operations on it later would be easier.
● Next was the implementation of three functions namely getSpatialRange(),
getSpatioTemporalRange(), and getKNNTrajectory() and return the obtained results.
In the second phase:
● The main task was to build an API that would connect these backend functionalities of spatial
range, Spatio-temporal range and KNN trajectory with a decent front end using the technology
stack of our choice (here: Django).
● Our team decided to take up HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to build the entire front end which
accepted the required inputs for the above functions and displayed the corresponding trips layer
data as the output on the web page.
● The connection between the front end and back end has been established using django
